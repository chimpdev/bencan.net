### Usage

Here's a basic example of how to use Bark.js:

<CodeBlock
  icon={<SiTypescript />}
  fileName="index.ts"
  language="typescript"
  children={`import { BarkClient } from '@thiskyhan/bark.js';

  // Initialize the Bark client
  const client = new BarkClient({
    // Optional: specify your Bark server URL
    baseUrl: 'https://your-bark-server.com',
    // Replace with your actual device key
    key: 'your_device_key'
  });

  // Send a notification
  client.pushMessage({
    title: 'Hello, World!',
    body: 'This is a test notification from Bark.js.'
