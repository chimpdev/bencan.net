Ever wanted to showcase your Discord status, current gaming session, or Spotify tracks on your personal website? Enter Lantern, a powerful service that makes it incredibly easy to broadcast your Discord presence in real-time. In this post, we'll explore how Lantern works and how you can integrate it into your projects.

## What is Lantern?

Lantern is a service that broadcasts your Discord presence through both a RESTful API and WebSocket connections. It's designed to be simple to use while offering robust functionality for developers who want to display Discord status information on their websites or applications.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Updates**: Get instant updates about status changes through WebSocket connections
- **RESTful API**: Simple HTTP endpoints for fetching user data
- **Spotify Integration**: Display currently playing track (if available on your Discord presence) 
- **Rich Presence Support**: Show detailed information about games and activities
- **Key-Value Storage**: Store and retrieve custom data for additional functionality
- **Ready to Use**: Works out of the box without any deployment needed

## Getting Started

### Using the REST API

The simplest way to get started is by using the REST API. You can fetch a user's presence data with a simple GET request to:

```
lantern.rest/api/v1/users/:your_id
```

This endpoint returns comprehensive information about the user, including:
- Current status (online, idle, etc.)
- Active platforms (desktop, mobile, web)
- Current activities
- Spotify listening data (if available)
- User metadata

### Real-time Updates with WebSocket

For real-time updates, Lantern provides a WebSocket connection at `wss://lantern.rest/socket`. The WebSocket implementation follows a simple protocol:

1. Connect to the WebSocket endpoint
2. Receive a hello message with heartbeat interval
3. Initialize the connection with your user ID
4. Receive real-time updates about presence changes

## Advanced Features

### Key-Value Storage

Lantern includes a built-in key-value storage system that you can use for:
- Storing configuration values
- Managing dynamic data for your website
- Keeping track of user preferences
- Temporary data storage

The KV storage system is accessible through both the REST API and WebSocket connections, making it versatile for various use cases.

### Customization Options

When fetching user data, you can customize the response with various parameters:
- Generate SVG representations of the user's status
- Choose between light and dark themes
- Adjust border radius and other visual elements
- Hide specific components like global name, status, or badges
- Customize "no activity" messages

## Implementation Example

Here's a simple example of how you might implement real-time Discord presence on your website:

<CodeBlock
  icon={<SiJavascript />}
  fileName="index.js"
  language="javascript"
>
{`const ws = new WebSocket('wss://lantern.rest/socket');

  ws.onmessage = event => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    
    if (data.op === 1) { // Hello
      // Set up heartbeat
      setInterval(() => {
        ws.send(JSON.stringify({ op: 4 }));
      }, data.d.heartbeat_interval);
      
      // Initialize connection
      ws.send(JSON.stringify({
        op: 2,
        d: { user_id: "YOUR_DISCORD_ID" }
      }));
    }
    
    if (data.op === 6) { // Presence Update
      // Update your UI with the new presence data
    }
  };`}
</CodeBlock>

## Self-Hosting Options

While Lantern is ready to use out of the box, you can also self-host it if you need complete control over the infrastructure. The project is open-source and includes detailed documentation for setting up your own instance.

## Conclusion

The combination of real-time WebSocket updates and a straightforward REST API makes it flexible enough for both simple implementations and complex applications. Plus, with the added bonus of key-value storage, you can extend its functionality to suit your specific needs.
